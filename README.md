# CIS-3296-FinalProjectProposal

# Abstract
The project is an attempt to find cheaper flight deals for a persona travelling from Destination A to Destination B. 
This is achieved by inputting the person's information, the amount of money he/she wishes to spend on the flight and the present and final destinations, which would further be checked through an API that will allow us to find a deal lower than the inputted information. 
If there is a match, the person is sent an automated message with the notification.

# Project Relevance
The project is in relevance to the course material as this would use the concept of Multithreading in order to make this available for multiple users to access the program at the same time. 

# Background
I like to think of possible forms of inconvenience being caused in our everyday life and try to come up with a feasible solution.

In regards to the project, the website mentioned inspired me to think of this project if there were easier ways to find a cheaper flight, which could be really useful in our everyday life.

# Resources Required
1. An API that allows us to find good deals between two destinations.
2. Python Libraries - GUI and Email Notification.
